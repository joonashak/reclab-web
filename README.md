# reclab-web

> ‼️ **_NOTE!_** This repository has been merged into [reclab](https://github.com/joonashak/reclab) monolithic repository and will no longer be maintained.

This app implements the Recover Laboratory website frontend.

## Deployment Strategy

Gatsby is used to populate the site with CMS data at build time. To achieve convenient re-deployments upon content changes, a webhook must be set-up for the CMS backend to be able to trigger re-deployment. The project is configured for Vercel static site hosting.

1. Push changes to the `trunk` branch. Github runs tests for the new `HEAD`.
2. Create a pull request to merge changes from `trunk` to `main`. The merge can be completed once all tests have passed. This triggers deployment to staging using the staging CMS, as well.
3. Publish a new release to deploy to production.

## CMS Backend

To develop and build this project, [reclab-cms](https://github.com/joonashak/reclab-cms) is required. For development, you should run the CMS on your local system. Clone the repository and follow the instructions therein.
